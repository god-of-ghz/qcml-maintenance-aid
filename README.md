# qcml-maintenance-aid
A command-line based maintenance aid system built for the QCML, but could be used for any industrial setting really.

1) Run the .exe (or compile yourself, and then run)
2) Add new machines as needed
3) Add tasks for those machines

It's pretty simple and self explanatory, and guides you through its own usage.
